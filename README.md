# Albronze

Albronze is a [Saltwater](https://github.com/jyn514/saltwater) spiritual successor/fork,
which aims to provide a spec-compliant preprocessor (for use cases such as bindgen), as well
as a full C compiler or transpiler.

Albronze is in the very early stages of development, and is not expected to be suitable for
production use anytime soon. The preprocessor is slightly further along, and will be the
main focus of current development work.

Albronze is currently licensed under BSD-3 clause, but I am open to relicensing it.
