# Albronze

Albronze is a [Saltwater](https://github.com/jyn514/saltwater) spiritual successor/fork,
which aims to provide a spec-compliant preprocessor (for use cases such as bindgen), as well
as a full C compiler or transpiler.

Albronze is in the very early stages of development, and is not expected to be suitable for
production use anytime soon. The preprocessor has been further tested on many edge cases
alongside GCC and Clang, but has not reached an adequate level of validation.

Albronze is currently licensed under BSD-3 clause, but I am open to relicensing it.
